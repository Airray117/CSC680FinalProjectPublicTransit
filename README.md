This application so far has the Muni Arrival View, which can be accessed as the mock version of MunitArrivalsView.swift
It is to demonstrate how it is supposed to look when taking the Muni API and show the nearest Muni bus stop and arrival time, either based
on the user's location or where the user's pin is on the map. The actual application can be accessed on ContentView. It is swift in the bottom
middle section.

A Blackjack game or 21 can be viewed on BlackjackGameView.swift or the bottom left when accessing ContentView.swift for the experience of the user using on their iPhone.
